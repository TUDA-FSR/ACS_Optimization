## Optimization of Attainable Control Sets and Weighted Pseudo-Inverse Control Allocation Matrices

This repository contains examples to optimize the Attainable Control Set (ACS) and the weighted Pseudo-Inverse Matrix. 
The files 'xx_eff_matrix' are used to create input matrices for different multirotor unmanned aircraft. The Jupyter notebooks 'tiltcopter' and 'octocopter' show examples of the optimization.
